# Simple Interview Management Solution

## Current Situation
- We have `candidates` table with single `interviewer_id` and `interview_date` fields
- We have a proper `interviews` table that supports multiple rounds, types, and interviewers
- We have full interview API routes already implemented

## Recommended Simple Solution

### 1. Keep Current Schema (No Changes Needed)
- Keep the existing `interviews` table as-is
- Keep the `candidate_notes_ratings` table we just created
- Remove the single interview fields from candidates table later (optional)

### 2. Simple Interview Flow
1. **Create Candidate** → No interview assignment initially
2. **Schedule Interview** → Use existing `/api/interviews` endpoint
3. **Multiple Rounds** → Create multiple interview records
4. **Interview Types** → Technical, HR, Managerial, Final
5. **Notes & Ratings** → Use `candidate_notes_ratings` table

### 3. Quick Implementation Steps
1. Update frontend to use interview scheduling instead of single interviewer assignment
2. Create simple interview scheduling UI
3. Display interviews in candidate profile
4. Use existing interview API routes

### 4. Benefits
- ✅ No database changes needed
- ✅ Supports multiple interviewers and rounds
- ✅ Already has proper API routes
- ✅ Simple and fast implementation
- ✅ Can be enhanced later

## Implementation Plan
1. Update candidate creation to NOT set interviewer_id/date
2. Create interview scheduling UI
3. Update candidate profile to show scheduled interviews
4. Use existing interview management system
